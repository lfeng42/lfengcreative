                    <p> In the spring semester of my third year at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), I was hired by the <font color = "black"><b>Georgia Tech Undergraduate Office of Education</b></font> to be their <font color = "black"><b>Graphic Design Student Assistant</b></font>. As their <font color = "da9d06">first and only designer</font>, I had full autonomy over all the designs of materials within the department and collaborated on marketing strategy with my boss.
                    </p>

                    Task
                    </center></h2>
                    <p> My main project was with the Summer Session team to create marketing materials to advertise the availability of summer courses at Georgia Tech, which was now branded as "Summer Session". This was especially important because at this time, the structure of summer courses had been completely changed from previous years. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The school's primary goal was to  <font color = "da9d06">increase enrollment of summer courses</font> by changing the branding and <font color = "da9d06">notifying students of the improvements to the summer session.</font> 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <hr align="center" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <h2><center>
                    Process
                    </center></h2>
                    <p> When talking to the head of my office and the other team members, I had a more detailed idea of the stipulations of the project in order to create informed end goals. They were having issues with informing the majority of students about the improvements in the summer program and standing out amongst the marketing materials of other departments on Georgia Tech's campus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Undergraduate Office of Education wanted to highlight all the positive changes that were implemented for this year's Summer Session. The summer tuition had been decreased; more courses were now being offered; and many minors could now be completed in one summer semester. 
                    Because the department had never hired a designer before, most the previous marketing materials had been created with formulaic templates that were distributed by the communications department.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After discussing with my team, I identified a few key goals I wanted the design and campaign to achieve. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Recognizable, fresh-faced design that's different from current Georgia Tech content</b></font></li>
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>Much of the marketing material from Georgia Tech departments is similar because most of the designs follow an outdated template to display information. In order to stand out, the designs must be unique compared to the others and have have an overarching theme/appearance so people will know it is for Summer Session regardless of whether the design is displayed on a poster or a T-shirt. Therefore, the campaign will be connected and cohesive.</li>
                          </ul> 
                        <br>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Stay within the Georgia Institute Communications Style Guide</b></font></li>
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>Georgia Tech has an official style guide for all content that relates to it. For all the designs I create for this Summer Session campaign, they must be approved by the Institute Communications department to make sure that the designs and marketing not only fit the Summer Session branding, but the brand of all of Georgia Tech. Keeping designs within the guidelines will streamline the timeline for marketing events.</li>
                            </ul> 
                        <br>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Versatile and easily adaptable to different materials</b></font></li>
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>The designs have to be easily adapted to multiple mediums of advertising. Because the timeline of printing the different marketing swag(free branded items that are given away for advertising) are often last minute. The designs must be able to be reformatted to meet these deadlines while still looking put-together. Materials and mediums mean posters, flyers, T-shirts, stickers, signs, and etc.</li>
                          </ul> 
                        <br>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Diversity and representation in marketing</b></font></li>  
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>Oftentimes, students are more receptive to things they can easily identify with. Especially as our society has progressed, Georgia Tech has been striving to create an inclusive environment for all kinds of students. Representation in the marketing materials would have a wider reach to more students from diverse groups.</li>
                          </ul>                   
                      </ul> 
                    </p>

                    Research
                    </center></h2>
                    <p> I decided to first look at the current marketing materials that other Georgia Tech departments had available and the design templates that were given to me to get a better idea of how to differentiate my designs from what is out there.
                    </p>
                   <div class="col-md-6">
                      <img src="img/techflyerex.png" alt="Flyer Examples" style="width:450px;height:auto;float:left;"> 
                      <img src="img/techdivposter.jpg" alt="Div Flyer" style= "width:450px;height:auto;float:left;"> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" style= "float:right;color:#666;">
                      <h4>Current GT Posters</h4>
                      As expected, most of the design of the current marketing materials from official Georgia Tech departments are quite similar. They use the same color palette and the same fonts. Most of the shapes (aside from the logos) are straight and angular, which is a nod to the technical aspect of the institute. The style of the flyers are easily recognizable as Georgia Tech-related material. I also love how the bottom poster has a women of color, which is great for student inclusivity. Photographs are the primary graphics in all of these advertisements as well.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      However, besides text and logos for Georgia Tech departments, there is no way design-wise to differentiate one marketing campaign from another.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12" style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px;">
                      <h4><center>GT Design Templates</center></h4>
                      <p>Next, I took a look at the templates that were given by the Communications Institute that was used by almost all the official Georgia Tech departments. The templates strongly encouraged design components like huge arrows to fit the tagline of "Creating the Next" and a minimum selection of colors.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      While looking at all these templates, it was difficult to tell exactly who they were targeted for. All the designs were the same whether it targeted parents, students, or professors. This made me think that I needed to create something that immediately called out to students.</p>
                       <div class="row">
                          <div class="column">
                              <img src="img/greytemplate1.png" alt="Grey Template 1" style="width:100%">
                          </div>
                          <div class="column">
                              <img src="img/greytemplate2.png" alt="Grey Template 2" style="width:100%">
                          </div>
                        </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <hr align="center" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <h2><center>
                    Final Product
                    </center></h2>
                    <p> 
                    With my designs for this campaign, I decided to move away from photographs as the main graphic and make the style of the designs completely illustrated. Because most of the other departmental flyers all heavily contained photographs, I thought this was a way to easily grab attention, especially with bold, solid colors. Illustration has a drastically different look from the current materials, which would make it stand out, and it has a more youthful and unique appearance that would appeal more to students. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created all the designs in Adobe Illustrator and formatted the print mediums in Adobe InDesign. 
                    </p>
                      <div class="row">
                          <div class="column" style="font-size:14px;">
                              <img src="img/charcolor.png" alt="Char Colors" class="responsive" style="width:100%">
                              <p><center><i><b>To the left</b>, these are all the characters that I created to be the "faces" of the campaign. <b>To the right</b>, this is a selection of the main colors I used from the official Georgia Tech Institute Communications style guide for Web/Digital Colors and a few from the Tertiary color palette as of 2018.</i></center></p>
                          </div>
                        </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to tackle the goal for more diversity, I decided to create 6 standard characters of different body types, gender, and ethnicities that would be present in all of the designs. If there were designs that could only fit a few characters, I wanted to create multiple versions of the medium, so that the characters could still fulfill their representation.
                    <div style="width:300px;font-size:12px;text-align:center;padding-top:5px;float:right;"><img src="img/gtwelcome.png" class="responsive" style="float:right;width:300px;height:auto;padding:2.5%;"alt="GT Standard"><i>This is an image I created for a Summer Session Instagram post.</i></div>

                    I illustrated them to look like happy students at Georgia Tech in students could identify with the characters and be more interested in the marketing materials. 
                    This made it easy to just transfer the character's images to other designs of other mediums, so designs could be quickly changed to meet deadlines for last-minute printing. 
                      All of the character's colors were mostly derived from the Georgia Tech Institute Communincations style guide for color palettes in Web/Digital and Print media. The colors were unchanged so they would be solid and bold. This was to make sure it was still within the guidelines of the school's branding, but also allow some room for creativity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was stepping away from the template styles of typical Georgia Tech material, but I knew it was important that it was obviously a Georgia Tech brand. In addition to applying the school colors, I added in many subtle GT logos into the work and created illustrations of our famous campus landmark, Tech Tower, and our iconic campus buses. The sun was also heavily incorporated in all the designs to make it clear it was specifically for the Summer Session program. A capitalized, chalky font called "Summeron" was used in some of the designs in order to seem more fun and playful instead of the rigid "Roboto" font, suggested in the templates. I only used the "Roboto" font for the postcards because they would be sent to student's homes and be viewed by parents, who would not be as receptive to a fun, playful font.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, the designs took on many forms as free swag, banners, and posters. The collection of many the different mediums I created designs for are shown below.

                    </center></h2>
                    <p>Working with the Georgia Institute of Technology Undergraduate Office of Education was a learning experience for me in many ways. The marketing campaign was well-received and received praise from other Georgia Tech marketing departments, as well as requests for illustration-type designs for their marketing as well. The Georgia Institute of Technology Institute Communications approved all the designs despite them not following exactly every stipulation in the official style guide.</p>

                    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Doing your preliminary research is important</b></font></li>
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>Designing is similar to creating something from a toolbox. If I had not made the effort to fully understand the task in the beginning, then the process would have not been as efficient. I would have started designing without knowing my goals, possibly wasting important time focusing on other groups. I would not have known about the limitations of the style guide or the mediums the designs were planned for.</li>
                          </ul> 
                        <br>
                        <li><font color = "da9d06"><b>Collaboration and feedback are important</b></font></li>
                          <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                              <li>On the team, I was the only designer and was in charge of creating all the visuals. I still needed to collaborate with others who were not familiar with design. They were crucial to me understanding how to work with the Institute Commuincations for approvals, and seeing the marketing materials from a fresh perspective that wasn't mine. Through them, my eyes were opened on how to improve my designs through further iterations. I learned to be flexible to restrictions and needs and to explain my design decisions to others.</li>
                            </ul> 
                        <br>                  
                      </ul> 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>If I could do this all again...</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p> Next time, I would use the same font for all the materials. "Roboto" and "Summeron" were fonts that did not look good together, as one was a rigid font with serifs and the other was san-serif and more organic in shape. I used them in different mediums. However, because of this, the design wasn't as cohesive-looking as it could have been. Because I left the position before the Summer Program started, I never had the opportunity to collect analytics on how effective the marketing campaign was. With this information, I could've understood more about what worked and what didn't work for future design campaigns.
