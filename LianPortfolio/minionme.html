                    <p> In Spring 2017, I had the opprotunity to work at Universal Pictures as a Games and Digital Products Intern. While there, I had the opprotunity to work with franchise-based mobile games like Pitch Perfect, Ellen DeGeneres, Jurassic World, and many others. I worked on many tasks like game testing/QA, competitor research, concept design/illustration, and creating mock-ups for up-and-coming games or updates to current games.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While I was interning, I worked a lot with our team's most successful and long-running game, Minion Rush. Minion Rush is a mobile runner game that was created in 2013 and has won many awards. My team created and were in charge of continuing the longevity of the game. We were always working on rolling out new updates and new features to keep the game alive for our active users. As a way to keep the popularity of the Despicable Me franchise alive and while working on Minion Rush tasks at work, I thought of MinionMe, a digital application that would add to the current hype.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created MinionMe as a passion project that I would worked on my own time after work hours.

                    </center></h2>
                    <p> I am personally an avid user of social media and have accounts on almost all the mainstream platforms. Snapchat <img src="img/bitmojilogo.png" class="responsive" style="float:right;width:200px;height:auto;padding:2.5%;"alt="Bitmoji Logo">is the social media platform that I probably spent the majority of the time on and I was immediately inspired by one of my favorite features of it: Bitmoji, an application in which users can create avatars that resemble themselves.

                    Prototype
                    </center></h2>
                    <p> 
                    For the prototype and the designs of the application, I created it all in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I made the design of the Minions in a 2-D design to make a more stylized version of how the stickers would look like while staying in brand as much as possible. I studied many of the clips and images of Minions in the films to make sure I narrowed down how they looked liked and what kinds of characteristics would still reflect the Minion personality.Through this way, it was easier to create more customization for all the individual Minions. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                      <h4>MinionMe App Icon</h4>
                      <p><img src="img/minionmeappicon.jpg" class="responsive" style="float:left;width:200px;height:auto;padding:2.5%;"alt="Minion Icon">For the App Icon, I created it using the eye and color of a Minion because it was easily recognizable. The black lines around the eye and the goggles was created to be similar to the cutting lines that you see. This is to show the "copy & paste" aspect of the app where you could change the features of the minion avatar depending on how you want it to make it uniquely you. This expresses the idea of an app in a simple illustration.</p>
                      <br> 
                      <br>
                      <h4>Interface</h4>
                      <p>In the app, the Minion would start out with a standard appearance and outfit like one of the Minions from the Despicable Me movies. It would be a simple interaction in which there would be a page for every physical characteristic of the Minion (eyes, hair, clothing, size etc) that could be personalized. The user would be able to easily click through the pages to create their own MinionMe. All the options would be graphic, so the user could easily visualize what the Minion would look like with the changed characteristic. The gold, yellow, and blue colors were used because they are the colors that are in the Minion's colors.</p>

                          <p>I created all these stickers in Illustrator. The font is called "BadaBoom BB", which I chose because it was reminiscent for comic book fonts. I wanted to do a more comic style for the stickers and the fonts because the colors and shapes in comic book art are bold and dramatic. In stickers, they are used to react to content and are oftentimes used to exaggerate responses. I created a variety of stickers with different emotions to give an example of how they would look like.

                          <p>In order to connect the app with Universal DPG's most popular application, adding a Minion Rush integration as an update would be the perfect opportunity to bring attention back to the mobile game. The only updates before were ones that changed the skin of the game or added extra levels that could bep played.

                        <p>Users could integrate their MinionMes into the application and use them as characters that could be played in the game, and even customized in the game using an awards system.

                    Why MinionMe / Pitch
                    </center></h2>
                    <p>After creating sketches and speaking about it with my EVP, I was given the opportunity to pitch my idea to the Universal Pictures Games and Digital Products team including our SVPs, producers, project managers, and other VPs. The following information was what I included in my pitch presentation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> 
                     Bitmoji is a mobile application that as of December 2017, had 43 million+ downloads in the USA, 767 million+ downloads worldwide, and a consistent growth of about 48,000+ daily downloads. This shows that customization of social media definitely works. MinionMe would accomplish goals that the Games and Digital Products team were struggling with and even bring in more money to the corporation. The following is a break-down of the benefits of what the application could bring.

                        <li>Extend the life of the Despicable Me franchise (especially during times when there are no new films released) </li>
                        <li>Keep up with popular social media trends</li>
                        <li>Bring in more revenue from the franchise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Reflection
                    </center></h2>
                    <p>This project was completely free reign and something I created out of my own interest and curiosity. I love the Despicable Me franchise and I always thought it was so interesting how unique the Minions were. It was an exploration of something that started out as a mild interest into coming up with a fully-fleshed concept. When I presented this concept to my team, it was well-received and even considered to be a future project for the next cycle of Despicable Me films. I was able to use Slack's sticker customization feature to upload all the stickers I made for the DPG team for them to use in their Slack chat. They all worked and were frequently used by team members!</p>

                    <p> Although I've stopped working on this project for the time being, I still would've liked to work on it more. I want to create a working, interactive prototype for this project and see if I can sync. It would be interesting to create a full range of stickers and learn how to create GIFs to integrate them into keyboards as well.

                    Unfortunately, because Despicable Me is a property of Universal Pictures where I no longer work, I can't work further and talk about this project publicly other than this because it has been pitched internally.
